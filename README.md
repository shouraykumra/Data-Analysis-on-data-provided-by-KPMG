# Data-Analysis-on-data-provided-by-KPMG
This is an EDA on the dataset that I was given through a virtual internship that I did with KPMG. The goal is to understand the trends of their data and how their customers, which in this case was a bicycle retailer company, could benefit from the analysis.

The analysis is done using simple graphs and libraries like Pandas and Numpy.

I was provided with 3 excel sheets, these were the data from the year 2017.
